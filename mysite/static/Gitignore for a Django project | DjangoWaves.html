  Gitignore for a Django project

If you are using Git for version control, you need a Gitignore file to
ignore all files that don’t matter and shouldn’t be in your git
repository. Think of your virtual environment and all the .pyc files.
Those are both generated and can be generated by anyone that has access
to your code. Therefore, it’s unnecessary to add those to your repository.

There are a lot of different file types and specific folders that you
don’t need. Even outside of Django. Think about your personal settings
in VS Code (if you use that). Here is a list which covers all things
that you can ignore through gitignore for every Django project you
start. Put this list in the root of your Django project and call it
|.gitignore| (yes, with the dot!).


    Here’s the ultimate Django gitignore #

    What we are ignoring and not with this Django .gitignore #
    <#what-we-are-ignoring-and-not-with-this-django-gitignore>


      Migrations # <#migrations>

A common question is: “why aren’t we ignoring migrations?”. Wouldn’t it
make sense to create the migrations on the server and then migrate them
right away? Yes, in some cases that would make sense, but there is a big
issue with that. You will always want to have the same migrations on
your development machine as on the server. Imagine this: you want a
field to be |False| for every record. You create a new field with
|default=False|, in this case all fields are fields. Then you decide to
change the field and change the |default| to |True|. The current fields
are still marked as |False| since you ran that migration first. If you
wouldn’t commit the migration files, all fields would be |True| since
the production server wouldn’t know that it was |False| previously.

Next to that, Django recommends including migration files as they are
part of the code base:

    The migration files for each app live in a “migrations” directory
    inside of that app, and are designed to be committed to, and
    distributed as part of, its codebase. You should be making them once
    on your development machine and then running the same migrations on
    your colleagues’ machines, your staging machines, and eventually
    your production machines.

      .pyc files # <#pyc-files>

Python will always compile your code to byte code. This is saved in the
.pyc files. You can’t do much with that and we don’t need it, python
will create them anyway. It’s best to just ignore them through .gitignore.
